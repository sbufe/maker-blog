###Retooling at age 42

Hello world.  This is Sierra.  I've been away for a long, long time.

I had a period of burnout.  I returned to college.  I cared for my mother as cancer cut short her life.  I've been working as a cabbie and keeping my father company, but now I'm ready to start over.  I'm looping back to software development and web design, and I couldn't be more excited to see what's changed during the last 12 years.

My goal for this blog is two-fold.  I'm reintroducing myself to the industry at the same time as I'm experimenting with innovations in web publishing and application development.

Please see my list of free resources and helpful guides to getting started.  I expect to be adding to it often.  I hope that documenting my learning will serve to help others also getting started (or restarted).

Drop me a line on any of my social media!
