###Retooling at age 42

Hello world.  This is Sierra.  I've been away for a long, long time.

I had a period of burnout.  I returned to college.  I cared for my mother as cancer cut short her life.  I've been working as a cabbie and keeping my father company, but now I'm ready to start over.  I'm looping back to software development and web design, and I couldn't be more excited to see what's changed during the last 12 years.
