The Android app Mr. Hyde makes blogging on a Github Pages Jekyll account simple and efficient.  It integrates with your Github account and lists your repositories to choose from.  Within a repo, it lists the posts and provides easy buttons to create a new draft or post. From there, you're in a Markdown editor.

Very easy to set up and gets straight to the point.
